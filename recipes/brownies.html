        <p>So let's make moisty, chocolatey BROWNIES!!</p>
        
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><b>2 eggs + water</b></li>
            <li><b>Powdered sugar</b></li>
            <li><b>Unsweetened cocoa powder</b></li>
            <li><b>Oil</b></li>
            <li><b>Vanilla Extract </b></li>
        </ul>
<h1>Steps to make brownies from scratch</h1>
<ol>
    <li>
<p> <strong>First, mix together the dry and wet ingredients in two separate bowls.</strong>
    Combine the sugar, flour, powdered sugar,
cocoa powder,</p> 
<p>chocolate chips, and salt in a medium bowl. 
    Then, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and water in a large one.</p></li>

    <li><strong>Next, combine the wet and dry ingredients.</strong> Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined. The batter will be thick!</li>

    <li><p> <strong>Then, pour the batter into an 8×8 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper. </strong> Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the pan</p>
        <p> and to smooth the top. The mixture will be very thick – that’s ok.</li></p>
  

    <li><p><strong>Finally, bake! </strong>Transfer the pan to a 325-degree oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out with a few crumbs attached.</p>
        <p> Allow the brownies to cool completely before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</p>

       <p> Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. They also freeze well for up to a month. Last time I made these, I doubled the recipe</p>
       <p> and stored the second batch in the freezer. It was so fun to have them on hand for a quick and easy dessert or afternoon treat!</p></li>
