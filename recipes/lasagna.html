                        <li> tablespoon olive oil</li>
                       <li> 1 pound lean ground beef</li>
                    <li> 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                       <li> 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                     <li>   1 (24 to 25-ounce) jar marinara sauce (3 cups), such as Rao's or Newman's Own</li>
                        <li>12 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded (about 3 cups), divided</li>
                       <li> 15 dry lasagna noodles (not no-boil, about 2/3 of a 1-pound box), divided</li>
                 </ul>
                 <h1>Steps</h1>
                 <ol>
                    <li><strong>Heat the oven to 400ºF.</strong> Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 400°F.
                    </li>
                    <li> <p> <strong>Brown the beef and onion.</strong> Finely chop 1 medium yellow onion.
                         Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 12-inch or larger regular or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering.</p>

                    <p> Add the onion, 1 pound lean ground beef, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, and cook,
                         breaking the beef up into small pieces with a wooden spoon,</p>
                        <p> until the beef is cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes.
                        Remove from the heat and let cool for 5 minutes.</p></li>
                        <li><p> <strong>Prepare the baking dish and assemble the meat sauce. </strong> Open 1 (24 to 25-ounce) jar marinara sauce (3 cups). </p>
                            <p> Spread a thin layer of the sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Stir the remaining sauce into the ground beef mixture.</p> </li>
                            <li> <p> <strong>Begin layering the lasagna. </strong>Shred 12 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese if needed (3 cups). Place 5 lasagna noodles in the baking dish,</p>
                                 <p> breaking them if needed to create a single layer (it’s OK if the noodles overlap slightly). Dollop and spread 1 cup of the ricotta cheese over the noodles.</p> 
                               <p> Dollop and spread about 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce on the ricotta, then sprinkle with 1 cup of the mozzarella. </p></li>
                               <li> <p> <strong>Continue layering the lasagna.</strong> Arrange 5 more noodles over the mozzarella, followed by 1 cup of the ricotta cheese, 
                                1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce,</p> 
                                <p> and 1 cup of the mozzarella. Top with a final layer of 5 noodles and the remaining sauce, 
                                spreading the sauce thin so that it almost completely covers the noodles. </p>
                                <p>(Reserve the remaining 1 cup mozzarella for the end of baking.) Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil. </p></li>

                                <li> <p> <strong> Bake the lasagna for 1 hour. </strong> Bake for 1 hour. Check to make sure the noodles are done by poking the lasagna with a knife;</p>
                                     <p> the knife should slide easily through all the layers. If it doesn't, cover and cook for 15 minutes more.</p></li>
                                     <li> <p> <strong>Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella and finish baking.</strong> Uncover the lasagna and sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella.</p> 
                                        <p>Bake uncovered until the mozzarella is melted and lightly browned, and the sauce is bubbling, 8 to 10 minutes more.</p></li>
                                        <li> <p> <strong>Cool the lasagna for 15 minutes.</strong> Let the lasagna cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes before serving.</p></li>
